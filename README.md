Assign tasks to specific students or groups.

Update task statuses: Not Started, In Progress, Completed.

Prioritize tasks as High, Medium, or Low.

Communication Tools:

Directly email tasks to students and parents with customizable formats.

Automated alerts for overdue tasks and upcoming deadlines.

In-app notifications for real-time task updates.

Reporting Capabilities:

Weekly progress reports for each student with visual data.

Performance comparisons over time.

User Interface:

Clean, user-friendly interface with task sorting by status, priority, and due date.
